 Sorting Visualizer

It is web development project which is used to visualize the sorting algorithms and performs the operation of algorithms step by step as the algorithms work like Bubble sort, Merge sort, Selection sort etc.
We shuffle the bars in a random order that is in a unsorted order.
We perform sorting algorithms on these bars to sort these bars in a ascending order by applying the different algorithms by clicking on the buttons of these sorting algorithms.
